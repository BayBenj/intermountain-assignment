# SQL Explanation
## schema.sql
I ran this script from the terminal in a sqlite3 environment. It should create a
CMS of 4 tables.

## pfunc1.sql
This script should be run second, because it populates the 4 tables.

## pfunc2.sql
I don't think I completely understood this step, so I just displayed the tables'
contents using `SELECT`.

## tfunc.sql
Incomplete - wasn't sure how to proceed.
